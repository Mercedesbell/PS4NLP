This is better than my aunts cake
There is chocolate in this dessert 
I can not believe they made all of these
They always make so many cakes a day
Nothing like a cake for breakfast
You should try every single one here
The cake is usually moist

That was alright cake

Could have tasted worse
Next time you should try adding more sprinkles 
The cakes color is very bland but tastes decent
This cakes flavor is very bland
This is as boring as playing chess but the taste definitely helps

I like the chocolate but hate the strawberry
I could take it or leave it
This cake was about as middling as it could be
I have had better cakes but I have also had worse
I wish it had looked better than it did
Had this cake looked or tasted better then maybe it could be considered good
The cake was fine but It could look more elaborate
If this cake was any worse it would be bad but its fine
That cake might be the least most average cake everThe cake was kind of ok
I never really liked or disliked desserts
When I go to restaurants I never have room for dessert so I do not know if I even like it
One day I ate cake that my grandma made and it was alright
I know that I feel indifferent about coconut cake

The carrot cake tasted mildly like carrots
I had no problem with the level of carrot in the carrot cake

The cake does its job but doesn't do anything to go above and beyond what you'd expect from a carrot cake
I didn't eat more than a slice but I did end up eating a slice
The carrot cake was okay
It's not my favorite but I'm decently okay with eating the carrot cake
The carrot cake isn't really a good meal replacement but it has its place anyways
