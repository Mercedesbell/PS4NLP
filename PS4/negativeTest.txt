the cake was awful and tasted like cardboard
this is a great disappointment just like me according to my father
Whenever I see a piece of cake it makes me want to cry
i would rather eat my own liver than one more bite of that cake
His cake not only tasted bad but it also gave me food poisoning
I've never had such a horrible cake before
I can't believe anyone would eat cake from Mrs Annes cake shop
This cake is very bad
They messed up my cake but refused to give a refund if you're reading this Bob you'll be hearing from my lawyer
how in the world did this cake make it onto bakery shelves it is terrible
The other day I microwaved french fries two days after ordering them and that tasted better than this carrot cake
I swear these people have no idea what good cuisine is trust me I work at a four star restaurant
The cake is terrible
Am having such a bad day
Cake will kill your dog if it is made of chocolate
what a sad excuse for a cake
I felt I was on the verge of diabetes when I took the first bite of that cake
the baker must have a low iq
This cake is leaves a bad taste in my mouth
The deserts here are way overpriced there's no way I'm paying that much for a pastry
the cake was dry and nasty
my dad hits me with cake
i never want to eat a cake like that again
I feel like throwing up
