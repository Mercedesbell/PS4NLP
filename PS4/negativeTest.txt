how could someone make such a monstrosity of a cake
the cake was awful and tasted like cardboard
NEGATIVE
This cake is disgusting I won't eat another piece
Too much cake being a good thing is a lie too little is still too much
there were carrots on my cake
Their banana nut bread tasted dry I needed three glasses of milk after I ate it
the cake was dry and nasty
This place used to be really good but its quality has declined over the years
It looked ok but the taste was bad
I have diabetes
That is the lousiest excuse for a cake that I have ever seen
this cake is chocolate so therefore not good
I hate this sweet mess more than my ex wife
my grandmother didn't give her life in a world war for the quality of this cake
this cake is just like mom used to make I always hated it
booo
I thought this cake was bad
this is my last will and testament I leave everything do the dog because my dog didn't tell me to come here
i think this cake is worse than the last one i ate
This cake is very bad
i have never had a cake that tasted that bad
I cannot stand cake even in the slightest
I like the inside pieces but they gave me an edge piece
